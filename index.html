  <h1>Off the Beaten Path</h1>
    <p>From pho and sushi to texmex and BBQ, from wine and beer to tea and coffee; Sacramento is host to a bevy of underrated food establishments and breweries. In the interest of limiting my list, I will only list a few of my favorite places that are more difficult to get to as they aren't located near midtown or good public transit.
    <br>
    <br>
    First, <strong>Pho Bac Hoa Viet</strong> located along <strong>Bradshaw just south of Folsom</strong>. This restaurant has a splendor of options of <strong>Thai, Vietnamese, and similar popular dishes.</strong> Their roll your own spring roll special is something different to try if you have never used rice paper before. Careful you don't stick it all in a mess!

    <br>
    <br>
    Next, <strong>Janoi's App Khao, Papaya and Noodle Shack</strong> located south off the 80 at <strong>Watt and Auburn</strong>. This place is home to wonderfully fresh dishes, treated in a way that leaves them more tender and full of spice. Last time there, I ordered this beef and lemongrass salad that was almost rare but so <strong>tender and delish.</strong> Even after taking some home and saving it for the next day, the meat had just marinated all-night and had just steeped in flavor!

    Finally, I'd like to give a special mention to all the local sandwich shops <strong>(not including Subway)</strong>. Nothing beats a good sandwich for eating on the run and here in Sacramento, almost every shop I've been to knows how to do it just right! So don't sub out a good sandwich, the local shops know how to slice it.
